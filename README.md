GENETIC ALGORITHMS

  A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution used to generate useful solutions to
  optimization and search problems.It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which
  otherwise would take a lifetime to solve.They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and 
  search problems.
